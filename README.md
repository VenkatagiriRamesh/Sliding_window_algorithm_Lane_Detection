# Lane Detection-Sliding Window Algorithm Method

## The following the steps of image processing and analysis involved in 'detection.py',
1. Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients using a set of chessboard images taken from Picamera.

2. Apply a distortion correction to raw images.

3. Use binary transforms., to create a thresholded binary image.
4. Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
5. Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary using sliding window algorithm.

6. Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
7. Project the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
